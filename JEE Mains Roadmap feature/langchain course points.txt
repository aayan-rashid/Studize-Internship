- open ai on azure for business

- chain of thought prompting for soca into roadmap?
based on the student's strength, weakness we could possibly do some few shot prompting or even cot prompting to better build a roadmap and focus on areas where he needs more time and work? classify the chapters based on the cognitive skills requirements?
but this increases the tokens sent...so cost increases
a solution...agents?

- sequential chain to implement agents easier and can introduce dynamicity? but very slow

- callbacks to handle edge cases, chains, tokens, models, errors and agents deployment?
langchain provides some built-in methods for that
